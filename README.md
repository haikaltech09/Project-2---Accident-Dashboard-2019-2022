# Project-2---Accident-Dashboard-2019-2022
Accident Dashboard with Tableu

Not all graphs showing a downward trend can be considered negative. For example, in this project analyzing accident data from 2019 to 2022, a downward trend in the graph is interpreted as a positive sign, as it indicates a decrease in the number of accidents over time.  

The analyzed data includes the number of accidents, categories of accidents, types of vehicles involved, number of victims, and the conditions and weather during which accidents most frequently occurred. All this information has been summarized concisely and informatively in this accident dashboard.  

**Conclusions:**  
1. In 2022, the number of accidents involving buses increased compared to the previous year.  
2. The increase occurred only for buses, while other types of vehicles showed a decline in accident numbers.  
3. Overall, the decline in accident numbers is a positive development, although not all sectors have shown improvements.  
4. The decrease in accident rates has also led to a significant reduction in the number of victims, with a notable drop in 2022.  
5. Most accidents still occurred in fine weather and on dry road conditions. ☀️🛣️  

**Recommendations:**  
1. Enhance education for bus drivers, considering buses carry a large number of passengers and thus pose higher potential risks. 🚌  
2. Provide training on the importance of adhering to traffic rules, such as obeying traffic lights and adopting safe driving patterns according to road and weather conditions. 🚦🌧️  
3. Include education on understanding the technical aspects of the vehicles they operate, such as inspecting and ensuring the vehicles are roadworthy. 🔧🚍  

By implementing these steps, it is hoped that accident numbers can be further reduced and road safety significantly improved. 🚸
